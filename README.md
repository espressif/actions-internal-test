# actions-internal-test

Sandbox repo for testing out [our GitHub Actions](https://github.com/espressif/github-actions/).

*Important* Due to the cron job constantly running, it's best to leave Actions disabled in this repo when not testing. You can re-enable under Settings -> Actions.

Note .github/main.workflow can be directed to use a branch in the github-actions repo for testing.
